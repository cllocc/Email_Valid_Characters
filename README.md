<p><strong>Cleaning Invalid Email Characters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>This instance we will clean invalid email characters from our data. This won&rsquo;t determine if they are valid. However it will give us an idea of who is actually interested in receiving promotional materials.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read data from our SQL database.</li>
<li>Use Pandas to view and sort.</li>
<li>Check to see if emails contain an &ldquo;@&rdquo; symbol.</li>
<li>Remove invalid email characters such as $%#~ etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tech</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Sqlite3</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>None of the variables have significant p-values.</li>
<li>We will fail to reject the null.</li>
<li>Not enough evidence to claim interaction between country and page received that on the basis of country there are more conversions.</li>
<li>Everything appears to be working just fine, don&rsquo;t fix what is not broken.</li>
</ul>
